#### Today's Progress:
- Compeleted readings of Chapter 1 of OpenIntro Statistics. I learned that there are 4 typing of sampling, they are simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling and multistage sampling.
- Also there are 4 principles of experiment design, including controlling, randomization, replication and blocking.
- Without random sampling, the sample can not be generalized to the population. Without random assignment, the experiment can not be concluded as causative. A good experiment design should include random sampling and random assignment.
#### Thoughts:
At first, I was confused between controlling and blocking, but then I realized that controlling is to control variations other than treatments; while blocking is to group by variations are not treaments and can not be controlled.
